# kickstarter-scrape

This repository contains files for a student project completed in 2012. The script is running at regular intervals to scrape data from the "Recent projects" page on kickstarter.com and uses this data to send updates to the SQL database of monitored projects. The resulting dataset contains a dynamic panel of projects, for which the evolution of contributions and associated success metrics were monitored for approximately six months.  

Unfortunately, due to changes in Kickstarter's website design, the script is no longer working.
